## Description

Instaverse is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to create profiles, upload photos, and interact with other users' posts. Users can like, edit, and delete posts, making it an ideal platform for sharing and viewing favorite photos and experiences.

## Usage

3. **Create Post**: Signed-in users can create posts by filling out the create post form in their profile, selecting a photo from their local files, and submitting the post.
4. **Edit/Delete Post**: Users can edit their posts by selecting the edit option on the top right corner of their post or delete the post by selecting the delete option.
5. **Like/Unlike Post**: Users can like other users' posts by selecting the like button. To unlike a post, users can select the like button again.
